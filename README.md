# Abstractive Text Summarization with T5
## Project Overview

This repository implements an abstractive text summarization model using the T5 transformer architecture. The model is trained on a dataset of news articles and their corresponding summaries.

## Key Features:

Pre-trained T5 Model: Leverages the power of a pre-trained T5 model for strong performance.
Fine-Tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a specific summarization dataset to improve accuracy.
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, tokenization, and batching for efficient training.
Model Training: Implements a robust training pipeline using Hugging Face's Transformers library.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like ROUGE.
## How to Use:

1-Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/abstractive-summarization.git

2-Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3-Prepare Data:

Download and preprocess your dataset.

Ensure it's in a suitable format (e.g., JSON or CSV).

4-Train the Model:

Modify the training script to specify your dataset and training parameters.

Run the training script:

python train.py

5-Evaluate the Model:

Run the evaluation script to assess the model's performance on a validation or test set.

6-Generate Summaries:

Use the fine-tuned model to generate summaries for new text inputs.

## Future Work:

Experiment with different T5 model sizes and architectures.
Explore techniques like distillation and knowledge distillation.
Investigate the impact of data quality and quantity on model performance.
Develop a web application or API to provide summarization services.
